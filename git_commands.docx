------------------------------------------

git reset head~ + N

this will remove N number of commits from the top of the commit's stack 

N represents the number of the commits needed to be removed

and it makes the last commit after reset(remove) not staged 


this means 🔻:
it makes two steps backward      ( working dir and staging area )

git reset --soft  head~ + N
this makes the same thing 

but
    it makes one step ( Step by Step) 

so
    it removes the file or the commit from the working dir 

but
    it still remains in the staging area

git reset --hard  head~ + N
his makes the same thing 

but
    it makes all the Delete steps 
so
    it removes the file or the commit from the working dir and staging area and  Discards the modified lines or files 

This means 🔻:
the Entire changes for the specified commit will be brune (Deleted) 

---------------- DELETE BRANCH --------------------------

git branch -d +name of the branch 
try to delete a specified branch 

as an Alert🚨🚨
this is the dry run of the command 
this happens when you are trying to remove un merged changes

but if you are strongly sured that you need to remove the branch 
use the following command🔻: 

git branch -D +name of the branch 
Delete a specified branch now
the difference is the D in Capital Case
